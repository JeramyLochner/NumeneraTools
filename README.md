# NumeneraTools
Tools for generation of characters in the tabletop rpg, Numenera  

These tools are 100% fan-made; I have no association with Numenera or Monte Cook Games and will take down any information if asked.  

# Character Generator
Tool for rapidly generating character and exporting to a character sheet for Numenera  
TODO:  
  Add Pool delegation for stats  
  Tier upgrades (Cypher use, skills, pools, etc)  
  Equipment (Picking)  
  Lore (Recommended Appearances, Backstories, Names, etc.)  
  Exporting to excel-friendly character sheet  
  Definitely more I can't think of at the moment
