[Bears a Halo of Fire]
description: You can create a sheath of flame around your body. You leave scorch marks wherever you go, and you can't handle combustible objects without first dousing you inherent flames.
cont_desc: If you perform esoteries, all your effects are tainted with flame. Fiery visuals accompany your powers, and in some cases, your predilection for flame actually reshapes your abilities to take on a fiery nature where non existed before.
connection: Pick one other PC. Through a quirk of fate, your fire cannot harm that character.
appearance: You probably wear red and yellow, or perhaps black. 
add_equip: Artifact--a device that sprays inanimate objects to make them fire-resistant. All your starting gear has already been treated unless you don't want it to be.
minor_effect: The target or something near the target catches fire.
major_effect: An important item on the target's person is destroyed.
class_suggestion: all
[Carries a Quiver]
description: The archer is a skilled combatant, deadly in any fight. With a keen eye and quick reflexes, you can eliminate foes at range before they reach you.
cont_desc: A skilled archer also learns to make his own arrows and bow.
connection: Pick one other PC to be the true friend who gave you the excellent bow that you currently use. Secretly pick a second PC (preferably one who is likely to get in the way). When you miss wth a bow and the GM rules that you struck someone other than your target, you hit the second character, if possible.
appearance: You probably wear no more than light armor so you can move quickly when needed.
add_equip: A well-made bow and two dozen arrows.
minor_effect: Hit in a tendon or muscle, the target takes 2 points of Speed damage as well as normal damage.
major_effect: The target is pinned in place with an arrow.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
[Commands Mental Powers]
description: You have always had special abilities that other didn't seem to share. Through practice and devotion, you have honed this unique talent so that you can harness the power of your mind to perform deeds.
cont_desc: No one can tell that you have this ability just by looking at you. Some people with mental powers--often called physics or psionics by ordinary people--are secretive and a little paranoid.
connection: Pick one other PC. You have found that this character is particularly tuned into your mental powers. While you're within short range of him, the two of you are always in telepathic contact, and he is never harmed by your Psychic Bursts.
appearance: You wear a crystal or a jewel somewhere on your head to help focus your power.
add_equip: Crystal or jewel artifact that, when worn against your forehead or temple, adds 1 point to your Intellect Pool. If you're ever without the artifact, subtracts 5 points from your intellect Pool; the points are restored if you regain the item.
minor_effect: The range or duration of the mental power is doubled
major_effect: You can take another action on that same turn
class_suggestion: all
[Controls Beasts]
description: To say that you have a way with animals and nonhuman creatures doesn't begin to cover it. Your mastery and communication with beasts is positively uncanny.
cont_desc: Animals come to you fearlessly, and it's not uncommon for birds to alight on your shoulder or small animals to climb on your arms or legs.
connection: Pick one other PC. That character seems to disturb your creatures in a way that you can't explain. You know you must keep your animals away from him if possible, or you might lose control of them.
appearance: You probably wear tough clothing and have a disheveled or grizzled appearance that suggest a rugged, outdoor life. Perhaps you even smell like an animal.
add_equip: Three days' worth of food for your beast companion, plus a harness, collar, or similar accounterment.
minor_effect: The duration of calmness or control is doubeld.
major_effect: The duration of calmness or control extends to 28 hours.
class_suggestion: all
[Controls Gravity]
description: Gravity must have been quite a concern for the people of prior epochs because there are many paths within the numenera to control it. Through a quirk of fate, some unique device, or supreme devotion (or all three), you have learned to tap into the power of gravity.
cont_desc: With one foot planted in the distant past, you are a mysterious individual. You have likely spent much of your life honing your odd, ancient talents.
connection: Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while using your gravitational powers, you accidentally sent that character hurtling into the air or plummeting towards the ground. Either way, she barely survived. It is up to the player of the character to decide whether she resents, fears, or forgives you.
appearance: You might prefer billowy garments that disply your mastery of gravity's pull and conceal your identity and intentions.
add_equip: Pen-sized oddity that tells the weight of whatever you point it at. The weight is displayed on a small glass plate in runes that only you can decipher.
minor_effect: The duration of the effect is doubled
major_effect: An important item on the target's person is destroyed
class_suggestion: all
[Crafts Illusions]
description: You use the numenera to create holographic images that appear real. You are, in effect, an artist--a crafter of light and sound.
cont_desc: Holographic images can never inflict direct harm or exert real force, but they can fool creatures, changing opinions and even behaviors if you craft them cleverly.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character is never fooled by your illusions and is never affected by the trickery of your special abilities. You can choose whether or not you know this fact.
appearance: You likely dress with flair and color. The appearance of things is important to you, both their beauty and their ugliness. You are a visual performer who can entertain, terrify, or fool everyone you encounter.
add_equip: An oddity that appears to be a piece of clear glass in a synth frame. By manipulating hidden switches on the frame, you can make random moving images appear on the glass. The images are usually strange and sometimes incromprehensible.
minor_effect: Your illusion has a special quality to it--perhaps an observer sees an image of something from his past.
major_effect: The illusion lasts for one hour, or if it already last that long, it lasts for 28 hours.
class_suggestion: nano
[Crafts Unique Items]
description: With the remains of previous civilizations all around, the raw materials for a crafter offer themselves to those who know where to look. You are a maker, a crafter, and a builder.
cont_desc: You might start out working with wood or metal as understood by the people of the Ninth World, but eventually you will master even the mysteries of the ancient. Call it magic or technology--you know that you can master it and use it for your own designs.
connection: Pick one other PC. The character has an extra item of regular equipment that you fashioned for her. (She chooses the item).
appearance: You likely carry a wide array of tools and spare parts wherever you go. Your work apron is probably a mainstay of your wardrobe, its pockets and loops brimming with the instruments of your trade. Your calloused fingers might be stained with grease that will never come completely clean, but these marks are badges of honor among your kind.
add_equip: Bag of light tools, the tools needed to make your first-tier crafts and any normal item that you can make with your skills. You also have an extra oddity.
minor_effect: Any rolls you make regarding that artifact gain a +1 bonus for 28 hours.
major_effect: Any rolls you make regarding that artifact gain a +2 bonus for 28 hours.

[Employs Magnetism]
description: Electromagnetism is a fundamental force in the universe, and it is yours to command. You are a master of metal.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. Whenever you use your powers, the metallic items on that character's body shudder, rattle, clink, and shake if he is within short range.
appearance: You probably wear a lot of metal, perhaps as part of your clothing or armor, as part of your accessories, embedded into your body surgically, or in some combination of these options.
add_equip: 
minor_effect: The duration of the effect is doubled
major_effect: An important item on the target's person is destroyed
class_suggestion: all
[Entertains]
description: You are an entertainer: a singer, dancer, poet, storyteller, or something similar. You perform for the benefit of others.
cont_desc: Naturall charismatic and talented, you have also studied to master your art. You know all the old poems, songs, jokes, and stories, and yo're skilled at creating new ones, too.

appearance: You probably wear flamboyant or at least fashionable clothes and use cosmetics, tattoos, or hair styling for dramatic effect.
add_equip: A musical instrument or other tools needed to perform.
minor_effect: You enchant the target, who remains enchanted as long as your focus all your attention on keeping her that way.
major_effect: The target is forever favorably disposed to you.
class_suggestion: jack
[Exists Partially Out of Phase]
description: You have the ability to change your phase state. In fact, you're always slightly out of phase, giving you a ghostly translucence. With concentration, you can pass your hand through a solid object, allow a solid object to pass harmlessly through you, or literally walk through walls.
cont_desc: However, moving in and out of different phase states requires extreme force of will and can be mentally taxing. The explanation for your strange powerl lies with some aspects of the numenera.
connection: Pick one other PC. You have known that PC for a while, and he helped you gain control of your phase states.
appearance: You might do whatever you can to play up your translucent appearance by wearing diaphanous, billowy clothing, or, depending on your personality, you might do just the opposite.
add_equip:
minor_effect: While out of phase, you also gain +1 to all Speed defense tasks
major_effect: While out of phase, you are also invisible.
class_suggestion: jack,nano
[Explores Dark Places]
description: You explore the foreboding ruins and mysterious locales of the ancient eras, trained in such activities by those who have gone before you.
cont_desc: You're the archetypical treasure hunter, scavenger, and finder of lost things. You spend so much of your time in the dark that you slowly adapt to it, almost becoming a creature of the gloom yourself. Even in civilized areas, you prefer to keep to the shadows.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character has been your adventuring partner in previous expeditions, and the two of you work so well together that you both gain +1 to any die rolls when you collaborate on the same task, ﬁght the same foe, and so on.
appearance: Most likely, you wear dark clothing to help you blend into the blackness. On the other hand, you might wear sensible garments and gear because you have serious and dangerous business to attend to in the dark. 
add_equip: An explorer's pack. If you already have one, you can instead take 50 extra feet (15 m) of rope, rations for two more days, and two minor glowglobes
minor_effect: The target is also dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. 
major_effect: The target is also stunned and loses its next turn.
class_suggestion: jack
[Fights with Panache]
description: You know that style is at least as important as substance. Defeating foes is secondary to looking good while doing it. 
cont_desc: Some might call you a swashbuckler or daredevil. You leap through the air, make a ﬂourish with your weapon, and attack, usually with a clever, biting show of wit. Your enemies hate you, but your allies adore you. Just watching you ﬁght is entertaining. 
connection: Pick one other PC. You're always trying to impress this character with your skill, wit, appearance, or bravado. Perhaps she is a rival, perhaps you need her respect, or perhaps You're romantically interested in her.
appearance: You very likely wear no armor, instead preferring stylish clothing—perhaps even a hat with a feather.
add_equip: A set of extremely stylish clothes and a jeweled weapon.
minor_effect: The target is so dazzled by your style that it is dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment.
major_effect: Make an additional attack with your weapon on your turn.
class_suggestion: jack,glaive
[Focuses Mind Over Matter]
description: Telekinesis. Psychokinesis. Mind over matter. The power has many names, but in the end, it all boils down to one thing--the molecules that make up all matter are yours to command.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. This character can cause your telekinetic powers to act oddly. Every once in a while, if he stands directly next to you, your powers are cancelled, but at other times, they seem improved when used near him.
appearance: Many telekinetics prefer to wear tight clothing without much accouterment so there is little another TK could grab hold of psychically. On the other hand, you have the power to create very minor telekinetic effects at will, so your hair might always be in motion, you could have a few tiny objects ﬂoating around you, or you might wear a long cape that's always billowing.
add_equip: 
minor_effect: An object moves faster or more efﬁciently.
major_effect: You can move or affect twice as much as normal.
class_suggestion: jack
[Fuses Flesh and Steel]
description: At some point in your past, some of your organic parts were replaced with artiﬁcial components. (Alternatively, you belong to a secret race of biomechanical hybrids.) These artiﬁcial components might be subdermal, or they might resemble more overt metal or synth plating on your skin. They can also take the form of threadlike tendrils of circuitry winding across your ﬂesh.
cont_desc: Whatever their appearance, these components give you special abilities. As you advance, you can add to, modify, or discover new functions for them. Unfortunately, your artiﬁcial body also has special requirements when it takes damage.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character knows your true nature, even if no one else does. If your components are not particularly hidden, she knows a different secret of yours, such as a preprogrammed word that will shut you down for ten minutes.
appearance: You probably wear a cloak with a hood or something similar to hide your artiﬁcial parts from those who would persecute you. Because your components are tricky to repair, as time goes on, it might become more difﬁcult to conceal your true nature, with exposed circuitry, metal plates, and more in a state of partial disassembly.
add_equip: A bag of light tools and a variety of parts to repair yourself.
minor_effect: Your servos learn from your successful actions. You gain a +1 bonus to similar actions involving the same task (such as making attacks against the same foe or operating the same device).
major_effect: You discharge a small pulse of power into your foe. Make an immediate attack against that foe (using the same stat as the action that caused the major effect). If the attack succeeds, it deals 4 points of electrical damage.
class_suggestion: all
[Howls at the Moon]
description: Sometimes the numenera is a double-edged sword. You are cursed and blessed to be able to transform into a powerful creature, drawing additional mass from a transdimensional source.
cont_desc: You and the GM should work out the exact nature of the creature, including its appearance, but it's a wild beast of rage and blood—at least until you learn to control it. Creatures like you are often called “lycanthropes.”
connection: Pick one other PC. That character is able to soothe you when You're in beast form. You'll never attack him while transformed, and if he spends three consecutive turns using his action to calm you down, you can revert to your normal form without having to make a roll.
appearance: Style and appearance are probably low on your list of concerns. Your clothes might be ragged because your transformation is hard on them (or they're cheap because you know they'll be destroyed the next time you transform).
add_equip: An accurate chronometer artifact that always lets you know when the next transformation is coming.
minor_effect: The target is so intimidated by your bestial attack that it is dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. 
major_effect: Your attack conveys a small bit of your lycanthropy. If your foe survives, one month later, he transforms into an uncontrolled beast. The GM decides what happens from there.
class_suggestion: all
[Hunts with Great Skill]
description: You are a tracker. Perhaps you hunt animals or more deadly creatures. Perhaps you go after people as a bounty hunter, law enforcer, or killer for hire.
cont_desc: Whatever form your hunting takes, you are trained in stalking your quarry and bringing it down. You are a dangerous individual.
connection: Pick one other PC. That person once saw you show surprising mercy toward your prey, and now you hope she keeps that information quiet—it might harm your reputation.
appearance: If you hunt animals or creatures, you might carry the trophies of past kills, such as teeth or skins. If You're a bounty hunter, you probably wear whatever your quarry would ﬁnd most intimidating so it feels as though it has no chance of getting away from you.
add_equip: Boots that mufﬂe your footsteps, giving you a +1 bonus to any roll made involving sneaky movement.
minor_effect: You can attempt an intimidating task to cause your foe to immediately surrender.
major_effect: Your foe pauses, terriﬁed by your prowess, and takes no action on his turn.
class_suggestion: glaive
[Leads]
description: Using charisma, natural leadership, and perhaps some training, you command the actions of others, who follow you willingly.
cont_desc: You are a commander, a captain, a leader, or a general. Your skills allow you to make people do what you want, but you also have the wisdom to know what actions would be best for your followers and allies. 
connection: Pick one other PC. That character was once a follower of yours, but you have since grown to think of him as a peer.
appearance: Since you need the respect of others, you probably dress and carry yourself in such a way that inspires, endears, or intimidates. You have a voice suited to barking orders that can be heard even on a noisy battleﬁeld.
add_equip: Artifact that allows you to tag up to seven followers. By looking into the glass plate on the device, you can determine their distance and direction relative to you. The tagging process is somewhat demeaning, so it is likely that only your followers would ever submit to it.
minor_effect: The next time you attempt to command, captivate, or otherwise inﬂuence the same foe, the difﬁculty of the task is decreased by one step. 
major_effect: The foe is inﬂuenced, captivated, or otherwise affected by your ability for twice as long as normal.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
[Lives in the Wilderness]
description: You dwell in the wilds. You probably have done so most, if not all, of your life, coming to understand the mysteries of nature, weather, and survival. The ways of ﬂora and fauna are your ways.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC who isn't from the wilderness. You can't help but feel a little contempt for that character and her “civilized” ways, which show disdain for all things natural and (to your mind) true. 
appearance: Your rough, rugged clothing shows little concern for style. Most of the time, covering yourself in natural smells to keep your scent from arousing suspicion in the wilderness is more important than bathing to keep yourself presentable to other humans.
add_equip: A directional compass.
minor_effect: A foe that is a natural creature ﬂees rather than continue to ﬁght you. 
major_effect: A foe that is a natural creature becomes warily passive.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
[Masters Defense]
description: Protecting yourself is obviously important in dangerous situations, and you are particularly good at it. 
cont_desc: Cautious and prudent, you learn techniques to defend against all kinds of attacks, both physical and mental. The winner is often the last person standing, and you've done all you can to ensure that person will be you. 
connection: Pick one other PC. This character protected you from harm recently, and you feel indebted to him for saving your life.
appearance: You carry a shield and probably wear the best armor you can ﬁnd.
add_equip: A shield.
minor_effect: You gain a +1 bonus to Speed defense rolls for one round.
major_effect: You gain a +2 bonus to Speed defense rolls for one round.
class_suggestion: glaive
[Masters Weaponry]
description: You have worked long and hard with one particular type of weapon: swords, axes, daggers, whips, or whatever you choose.
cont_desc: Thus, you are a swordsman, an axemaster, a mistress of knives, or whatever is appropriate to your chosen weapon. A master of the rapier is different from a master of the warhammer. 
connection: Pick one other PC. That character shows potential in the use of your weapon. You would like to train her, but You're not necessarily qualiﬁed to teach (that's up to you), and she might not be interested (that's up to her).
appearance: You might wear a symbol—a badge, a pin, a tattoo, an amulet, certain colors, and so on—that indicates the school in which you trained, the style of ﬁghting you have mastered, or the name of your mentor. Your weapon is almost certainly your ﬁnest possession. Not only is it well cared for and of high quality, but you probably keep it in a beautiful scabbard, harness, belt, case, or something similar. 
add_equip: A high-quality weapon of your choosing. 
minor_effect: The target is so dazzled by your expertise that it is dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment.
major_effect: Make an immediate additional attack with the weapon as part of your turn.
class_suggestion: glaive
[Murders]
description: The murderous assassin is a master of dealing death. No one is better at sneaking into a location, eliminating a target, and slipping out again. Obviously, a professional killer is not likely to have a lot of friends. 
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. That character knows your real identity, profession, and background. To all others, the truth about you is a closely guarded secret.
appearance: You probably wear dark colors—black, charcoal grey, or midnight blue—to help blend into the shadows. But since You're also a master of disguise, in truth you could look like anyone.
add_equip: A disguise kit and three doses of a level 2 blade poison that inﬂicts 5 points of damage.
minor_effect: No one but the foe notices that you make the attack.
major_effect: If you have poison amid your belongings, you were able to apply it just before the strike, adding the poison's effects to the normal attack damage.
class_suggestion: all
[Rages]
description: The berserker is a feared ﬁghter who cannot be stopped. You put yourself into a howling battle frenzy that can make you a terror on the battleﬁeld. You might hail from a less civilized society, perhaps even a tribal one. 
cont_desc:
connection: Choose one other PC. You feel strangely protective toward that character and don't want to see her come to harm. 
appearance: You likely wear little or no armor so as not to restrict your speed or maneuverability. Your clothing is probably simple and utilitarian. 
add_equip: 
minor_effect: When ﬁghting multiple foes, you knock one into another, putting both off balance. As a result, treat both foes as one level lower for one round. 
major_effect:  Your foe is terriﬁed of your rage and uses his next two actions to ﬂee.
class_suggestion: glaive
[Rides the Lightning]
description: The ancients harnessed electricity in strange and wonderful ways. Through practice and inherent ability (or the subtle use of hidden or implanted devices), you control the same energy.
cont_desc: Not only can you create and discharge electrical power, but you can eventually learn to use it to transport yourself.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character has been your friend for a long time, and you have learned to bring her along when you ride the lightning. If the character is standing right next to you, you can take her with you when you use the Bolt Rider or Electrical Flight powers. (Normally, neither ability allows you to transport other creatures.) 
appearance: You probably wear tight-ﬁtting clothing that allows you to move quickly. Your garments might be blue and black, perhaps with a lightning-bolt motif.
add_equip: A bag of miscellaneous batteries and power cells. Whenever you ﬁnd a new device that operates on batteries or cells (GM discretion), there is a 75 percent chance that the bag contains one that will power it if it depletes.
minor_effect: The target is dazed by electricity for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. Electricity can also shut down an android, robot, or other automaton for one round.
major_effect:  Devices killed with electrical power explode. You can target and destroy an artifact that a foe is holding or wearing.
class_suggestion: nano,jack
[Talks to Machines]
description: Since you were young, you had an afﬁnity for machines. It seemed almost like you were speaking to them.
cont_desc: You were. You have the ability to use your organic brain like a computer, interfacing “wirelessly” with any electronic device. You can control and inﬂuence them in ways that others can't. Computers are your friends and companions. You have also learned to repair machines of all kinds because the better they work, the better off you are as well.
connection: Pick one other PC. That character seems to have a terrible relationship with machines—or at least the machines that you communicate with. If she is next to a machine that you interact with in a friendly manner, that machine is treated in all ways as being one level lower than normal (unless doing so beneﬁts you or her, in which case the level does not change). 
appearance: You likely wear a tool belt full of various implements, and machine oils stain your clothes and ﬁngertips.
add_equip: A bag of small tools. 
minor_effect: The duration of inﬂuence or control is doubled.
major_effect: The duration of inﬂuence or control becomes 28 hours.
class_suggestion: nano
[Wears a Sheen of Ice]
description: Through your studies, you have learned to focus your natural talents to command the powers of ice and cold. People might refer to you as an ice mage.
cont_desc: Sometimes ice mages are thought to come into conﬂict with those known as ﬁre mages, but this is a fallacy believed by ordinary folks more than anything based in truth. 
connection: Pick one other PC. Due to a quirk of the numenera, if that character is standing next to you when you use your Ice Armor ability, he is also protected by a sheen of ice. (He does not get the added protection of your Resilient Ice Armor ability.)
appearance: You likely wear white or blue garments that are heavier than they need to be—unless you live in a cold region or wintry clime, in which case you probably wear less clothing than other people do because the cold doesn't bother you.
add_equip: A bladed weapon made of stronglass that looks like ice.
minor_effect: The surface around the target becomes slick and difﬁcult to stand on. 
major_effect: The target is covered in ice that hinders its movement for one minute, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment.
class_suggestion: nano
[Wields Power with Precision]
description: Not only are you blessed with a great command of the numenera, but you are also trained to exploit esoteries in ways that elevate you above other nanos and jacks.
cont_desc: Some people believe that those who perform esoteries are born with the ability, but you know that skill and intelligence play important roles. The ancients created the numenera through knowledge, discovery, and intellect, and to use it properly, you must follow the same path. 
connection:  Pick one other PC. You've placed an immutable, one-time ward that renders her immune to the esoteries you perform unless she wants to be affected. 
appearance: You probably wear spectacles and dapper outﬁts, carrying extra books, notebooks, and pens so you can continually focus on your studies and experiments. 
add_equip: An additional book on the subject of the numenera
minor_effect: The esotery overwhelms and dazzles the target for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. 
major_effect: The esotery terriﬁes the target, who uses its next two turns to ﬂee.
class_suggestion: nano
[Wields Two Weapons at Once]
description: You bear steel with both hands, ready to take on any foe. You ﬁght with two weapons in melee, sometimes called dual wielding. A fearsome warrior, quick and strong, you believe that the best defense is a strong offense.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. You have trained with this character so much that if the two of you stand back to back in a ﬁght, you both gain a +1 bonus to Speed defense tasks.
appearance: You probably sheathe one weapon on each side or both crossed behind your back. They are likely your most prized possessions, and you might have names for them.
add_equip: An additional light melee weapon.
minor_effect: The target is intimidated and ﬂees as its next action. 
major_effect: You can make an immediate additional attack with one of your weapons.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
[Works Miracles]
description: You manipulate matter and time to help others and are beloved by everyone you encounter. Some people consider you a representative of the gods or a power from beyond this world.
cont_desc: Perhaps they're right-transdimensional experiments in the prior worlds might be what created the energies that you now wield. 
connection: Pick one other PC. This character quietly suspects that You're a messiah or supernatural being. You can choose whether or not You're aware of his suspicion. 
appearance: You probably wear simple clothes—nothing too ﬂashy or stylish. There's no need to call more attention to yourself.
add_equip: 
minor_effect: The target is healed for 1 additional point. 
major_effect: The target is healed for 2 additional points.

[Works with Back Alleys]
description: The thief, the burglar, the pickpocket: these are the dangerous individuals who haunt the back alleys of every community. You are a thief in a city or town, making your livelihood at the expense of the wealthy.
cont_desc: Your talents, however, prepare you for all kinds of pursuits, even when You're not crouching in an alley or climbing into a window. 
connection:  Pick one other PC. The character knew you beforehand and convinced you to leave your life of crime for other pursuits—at least temporarily
appearance: Usually, you dress to blend in with the crowd. When You're on a mission, black, form-ﬁtting clothing allows you to swim in the shadows
add_equip: A bag of light tools
