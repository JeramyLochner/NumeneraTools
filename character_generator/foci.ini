[Bears a Halo of Fire]
description: You can create a sheath of flame around your body. You leave scorch marks wherever you go, and you can't handle combustible objects without first dousing you inherent flames.
cont_desc: If you perform esoteries, all your effects are tainted with flame. Fiery visuals accompany your powers, and in some cases, your predilection for flame actually reshapes your abilities to take on a fiery nature where non existed before.
connection: Pick one other PC. Through a quirk of fate, your fire cannot harm that character.
appearance: You probably wear red and yellow, or perhaps black. 
add_equip: Artifact--a device that sprays inanimate objects to make them fire-resistant. All your starting gear has already been treated unless you don't want it to be.
minor_effect: The target or something near the target catches fire.
major_effect: An important item on the target's person is destroyed.
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Shround of Flame | (1 Intellect point) | At your command, your entire body becomes shrouded in ﬂames that last up to ten minutes. The ﬁre doesn’t burn you, but it automatically inﬂicts 2 points of damage to anyone who tries to touch you or strike you with a melee attack. Flames from another source can still hurt you. While the shroud is active, you gain +2 points of Armor that protect only against damage from ﬁre from another source. Enabler.
tier2: Hurl Flame | (2 Intellect points) | While your Shroud of Flame is active, you can reach into your halo and hurl a handful of ﬁre at a target. This is a ranged attack with short range that deals 4 points of ﬁre damage. Action. $ Fiery Power | When you use the Onslaught force blast esotery or the Flash esotery, increase the damage by 1 point. If you don’t have either of those abilities, this ability has no effect. Fiery Power does not affect damage from the Onslaught mindslice. Enabler.
tier3: Fiery Hand of Doom | (3 Intellect points) | While your Shroud of Flame is active, you can reach into your halo and produce a hand made of animate ﬂame that is twice the size of a human’s hand. The hand acts as you direct, ﬂoating in the air. Directing the hand is an action. Without a command, the hand does nothing. It can move a long distance in a round, but it never moves farther away from you than long range. The hand can grab, move, and carry things, but anything it touches takes 1 point of damage per round from the heat. The hand can also attack. It’s a level 3 creature and deals 1 extra point of damage from ﬁre when it attacks. Once created, the hand lasts for ten minutes. Action to create; action to direct.
tier4: Flameblade | (4 Intellect points) | When you wish it, you extend your halo of ﬁre to cover a weapon you wield in ﬂame for one hour. The ﬂame ends if you stop holding or carrying the weapon. While the ﬂame lasts, the weapon inﬂicts 2 additional points of damage. Enabler.
tier5: Fire Tendrils | (5 Intellect points) |  When you wish it, your halo sprouts three tendrils of ﬂame that last for up to ten minutes. As an action, you can use the tendrils to attack, making a separate attack roll for each. Each tendril inﬂicts 4 points of damage. Otherwise, the attacks function as standard attacks. If you don’t use the tendrils to attack, they remain but do nothing. Enabler.
tier6: Fire Servant | (6 Intellect points) | You reach into your halo and produce an automaton of ﬁre that is your general shape and size. It acts as you direct each round. Directing the servant is an action, and you can command it only when you are within long range of it. Without a command, the servant continues to follow your previous command. You can also give it a simple programmed action, such as “Wait here, and attack anyone who comes within short range until they’re dead.” The servant lasts for ten minutes, is a level 5 creature, and deals 1 extra point of damage from ﬁre when it attacks. Action to create; action to direct.
[Carries a Quiver]
description: The archer is a skilled combatant, deadly in any fight. With a keen eye and quick reflexes, you can eliminate foes at range before they reach you.
cont_desc: A skilled archer also learns to make his own arrows and bow.
connection: Pick one other PC to be the true friend who gave you the excellent bow that you currently use. Secretly pick a second PC (preferably one who is likely to get in the way). When you miss wth a bow and the GM rules that you struck someone other than your target, you hit the second character, if possible.
appearance: You probably wear no more than light armor so you can move quickly when needed.
add_equip: A well-made bow and two dozen arrows.
minor_effect: Hit in a tendon or muscle, the target takes 2 points of Speed damage as well as normal damage.
major_effect: The target is pinned in place with an arrow.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
tier1: Archer | To be truly deadly with a bow, you must know where to aim. You can spend points from either your Speed Pool or your Intellect Pool to apply levels of Effort to increase your bow damage. Each level of Effort adds 3 points of damage to a successful attack. Enabler. $ Fletcher | You are trained in making arrows. Enabler.
tier2: Covering Fire | (1 Speed point) | In a round where you attack with your bow, if you ﬁre an additional arrow, the difﬁculty of attacks and special abilities used by the target is increased by one step. Enabler. $ Bowyer | You are trained in making bows. Enabler.
tier3: Trained Archer | You are trained in using bows. Enabler. $ Master Fletcher | You are specialized in making arrows. Enabler.
tier4: Quick Shot |  If you roll a natural 17 or higher with a bow attack, instead of adding damage or a minor or major effect, you can make another attack with your bow. This attack reuses the same Effort and bonuses (if any) from the ﬁrst attack. Enabler. $ Master Bowyer | You are specialized in making bows. Enabler.
tier5: Phenomenal Archer | You are specialized in using bows. Enabler.
tier6: Powerful Shot | (2 Might points) | You inﬂict 3 additional points of damage with a bow. The Might points spent to use this ability are in addition to any Speed points spent on the attack. Enabler.
[Commands Mental Powers]
description: You have always had special abilities that other didn't seem to share. Through practice and devotion, you have honed this unique talent so that you can harness the power of your mind to perform deeds.
cont_desc: No one can tell that you have this ability just by looking at you. Some people with mental powers--often called physics or psionics by ordinary people--are secretive and a little paranoid.
connection: Pick one other PC. You have found that this character is particularly tuned into your mental powers. While you're within short range of him, the two of you are always in telepathic contact, and he is never harmed by your Psychic Bursts.
appearance: You wear a crystal or a jewel somewhere on your head to help focus your power.
add_equip: Crystal or jewel artifact that, when worn against your forehead or temple, adds 1 point to your Intellect Pool. If you're ever without the artifact, subtracts 5 points from your intellect Pool; the points are restored if you regain the item.
minor_effect: The range or duration of the mental power is doubled
major_effect: You can take another action on that same turn
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Telepathic | (1+ Intellect point) | You can speak telepathically with others who are within short range. Communication is two-way, but the other party must be willing and able to communicate. You don’t have to see the target, but you must know that it’s within range. You can have more than one active contact at once, but you must establish contact with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the duration rather than affect the difﬁculty, the contact lasts for 28 hours. Action to establish contact.
tier2: Mind Reading | (2 Intellect points) | You can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range, even if the target doesn’t want you to. You must be able to see your target. Once you have established contact, you can read the target’s thoughts for up to one minute. If you also have the Mind Reading esotery or trick of the trade, you can use this ability at long range, and you don’t need to be able to see the target (but you do have to know that the target is within range). Action to initiate.
tier3: Psychic Burst | (3+ Intellect points) | You blast waves of mental force into the minds of up to three targets within short range (make an Intellect roll against each target). This burst inﬂicts 3 points of Intellect damage (and thus ignores Armor). For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, you can make an Intellect attack roll against an additional target. Action.
tier4: Use Sense of Others | (4 Intellect points) | You can see, hear, smell, touch, and taste through the senses of anyone with whom you have telepathic contact. You can attempt to use this ability on a willing or unwilling target within long range; an unwilling target can try to resist. You don’t need to see the target, but you must know that it’s within range. Your shared senses last ten minutes. Action to establish.
tier5: Mind Control | (6+ Intellect points) | You control the actions of another creature you touch. This effect lasts for ten minutes. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once you have established control, you maintain mental contact with the target and sense what it senses. You can allow it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difﬁculty, you can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to control the mind of a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. If you also have the Mind Control esotery, the normal level limit is 3 rather than 2. When the effect ends, the creature doesn’t remember being controlled or anything it did while under your command. Action to initiate.
tier6: Telepathic Newtork (0+ Intellect points) | When you wish it, you can contact up to ten creatures known to you, no matter where they are. All targets must be willing and able to communicate. You automatically succeed at establishing a telepathic network; no roll is required. All creatures in the network are linked and can communicate telepathically with one another. They can also “overhear” anything said in the network, if they wish. Activating this ability doesn’t require an action and doesn’t cost Intellect points; to you, it’s as easy as speaking out loud. The network lasts until you choose to end it. If you spend 5 Intellect points, you can contact twenty creatures at once, and for every 1 Intellect point you spend above that, you can add ten more creatures to the network. These larger networks last for ten minutes. Creating a network of twenty or more creatures does require an action to establish contact. Enabler.
[Controls Beasts]
description: To say that you have a way with animals and nonhuman creatures doesn't begin to cover it. Your mastery and communication with beasts is positively uncanny.
cont_desc: Animals come to you fearlessly, and it's not uncommon for birds to alight on your shoulder or small animals to climb on your arms or legs.
connection: Pick one other PC. That character seems to disturb your creatures in a way that you can't explain. You know you must keep your animals away from him if possible, or you might lose control of them.
appearance: You probably wear tough clothing and have a disheveled or grizzled appearance that suggest a rugged, outdoor life. Perhaps you even smell like an animal.
add_equip: Three days' worth of food for your beast companion, plus a harness, collar, or similar accounterment.
minor_effect: The duration of calmness or control is doubeld.
major_effect: The duration of calmness or control extends to 28 hours.
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Beast Companion | A level 2 creature of your size or smaller accompanies you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you’ll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The beast companion acts on your turn. As a level 2 creature, it has a target number of 6 and a health of 6, and it inﬂicts 2 points of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your beast companion dies, you can hunt in the wild for 1d6 days to ﬁnd a new companion. Enabler.
tier2: Soothe the Savage | (2 Intellect points) | You calm a nonhuman beast within 30 feet (9 m). You must speak to it (although it doesn’t need to understand your words), and it must see you. It remains calm for one minute or for as long as you focus all your attention on it. The GM has ﬁnal say over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature before you attempt to use this ability on it. Aliens, extradimensional entities, very intelligent creatures, and automatons never count. Action. $ Communication | (2 Intellect points) | You can convey a basic concept to a creature that normally can’t speak or understand speech. The creature can also give you a very basic answer to a simple question. Action.
tier3: Mount | A level 3 creature serves you as a mount and follows your instructions. While you’re mounted on it, the creature can move and you can attack on your turn, or it can attack foes when you do. You and the GM must work out the details of the creature, and you’ll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The mount acts on your turn. If your mount dies, you can hunt in the wild for 3d6 days to ﬁnd a new one. Enabler.
tier4: Beast Eyes | (3 Intellect points) | You can sense through your beast companion’s senses if it is within 1 mile (1.6 km) of you. This effect lasts up to ten minutes. Action to establish. $ Improved Companion | Your beast companion increases to level 4. As a level 4 creature, it has a target number of 12 and a health of 12, and it inﬂicts 4 points of damage. Enabler. 
tier5: Beast Call | (5 Intellect points) | You summon a horde of small animals or a single level 4 beast to help you temporarily. These creatures do your bidding for as long as you focus your attention, but you must use your action each turn to direct them. Creatures are native to the area and arrive under their own power, so if you’re in an unreachable place, this ability won’t work. Action.
tier6: Control the Savage | (6 Intellect points) | You can control a calm nonhuman beast within 30 feet (9 m). You control it for as long as you focus all your attention on it, using your turn each round. The GM has ﬁnal say over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature before you attempt to use this ability on it. Aliens, extradimensional entities, very intelligent creatures, and automatons never count. Action. $ Improved Companion | Your beast companion increases to level 5. As a level 5 creature, it has a target number of 15 and a health of 15, and it inﬂicts 5 points of damage. Enabler.
[Controls Gravity]
description: Gravity must have been quite a concern for the people of prior epochs because there are many paths within the numenera to control it. Through a quirk of fate, some unique device, or supreme devotion (or all three), you have learned to tap into the power of gravity.
cont_desc: With one foot planted in the distant past, you are a mysterious individual. You have likely spent much of your life honing your odd, ancient talents.
connection: Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while using your gravitational powers, you accidentally sent that character hurtling into the air or plummeting towards the ground. Either way, she barely survived. It is up to the player of the character to decide whether she resents, fears, or forgives you.
appearance: You might prefer billowy garments that disply your mastery of gravity's pull and conceal your identity and intentions.
add_equip: Pen-sized oddity that tells the weight of whatever you point it at. The weight is displayed on a small glass plate in runes that only you can decipher.
minor_effect: The duration of the effect is doubled
major_effect: An important item on the target's person is destroyed
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Hover | (1 Intellect point) | You ﬂoat slowly into the air. As your action, you can concentrate to remain motionless in the air, or ﬂoat up to a short distance, but no more; otherwise, you drift with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts for up to ten minutes. If you also have the Hover esotery or trick of the trade, you can hover for twenty minutes and move your normal speed. Action to initiate.
tier2: Lessening Gravity's Pull | By manipulating gravity’s pull on yourself, you gain +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler.
tier3: Gravity Cleave | (3 Intellect points) | You can harm a target within short range by rapidly increasing gravity’s pull on one portion of the target and decreasing it on another, inﬂicting 6 points of damage. Action.
tier4: Field of Gravity | (4 Intellect points) | When you wish it, a ﬁeld of manipulated gravity around you pulls incoming ranged projectile attacks to the ground. You are immune to such attacks until your turn in the next round. You must be aware of an attack to foil it. This ability does not work on energy attacks. Enabler.
tier5: Flight | (4+ Intellect points) | You can ﬂoat and ﬂy through the air for one hour. For each level of Effort applied, you can affect one additional creature of your size or smaller. You must touch the creature to bestow the power of ﬂight. You direct the other creature’s movement, and while ﬂying, it must remain within sight of you or fall. In terms of overland movement, a ﬂying creature moves about 20 miles (32 km) per hour and is not affected by terrain. Action to initiate. 
tier6: Weight of the World | (6+ Intellect points) | You can increase a target’s weight dramatically. The target is pulled to the ground and can’t move physically under its own power for one minute. The target must be within short range. For each level of Effort applied, you can affect one additional creature. Action.
[Crafts Illusions]
description: You use the numenera to create holographic images that appear real. You are, in effect, an artist--a crafter of light and sound.
cont_desc: Holographic images can never inflict direct harm or exert real force, but they can fool creatures, changing opinions and even behaviors if you craft them cleverly.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character is never fooled by your illusions and is never affected by the trickery of your special abilities. You can choose whether or not you know this fact.
appearance: You likely dress with flair and color. The appearance of things is important to you, both their beauty and their ugliness. You are a visual performer who can entertain, terrify, or fool everyone you encounter.
add_equip: An oddity that appears to be a piece of clear glass in a synth frame. By manipulating hidden switches on the frame, you can make random moving images appear on the glass. The images are usually strange and sometimes incromprehensible.
minor_effect: Your illusion has a special quality to it--perhaps an observer sees an image of something from his past.
major_effect: The illusion lasts for one hour, or if it already last that long, it lasts for 28 hours.
class_suggestion: nano
tier1: Minor Illusion | (1 Intellect point) | You create a single image of a creature or object within immediate range. The image must ﬁt within a 10-foot (3-meter) cube. The image can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a person walk or attack), but it can’t leave the area deﬁned by the cube. The illusion includes sound but not smell. It lasts for ten minutes, but if you want to change the original illusion signiﬁcantly—such as making a creature appear to be wounded—you must concentrate on it again (though doing so doesn’t cost additional Intellect points). If you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create; action to modify. 
tier2: Disguise | (2+ Intellect points) | You appear to be someone or something else, roughly of your size and shape, for up to one hour. Once created, the disguise requires no concentration. For each additional Intellect point you spend, you can disguise one other creature. All disguised creatures must stay within sight of you or lose their disguise. Action to create.
tier3: Major Illusion | (3 Intellect points) | You create a complex scene of images within immediate range. The entire scene must ﬁt within a 100-foot (30-meter) cube. The images can move, but they can’t leave the area deﬁned by the cube. The illusion includes sound and smell. It lasts for ten minutes and changes as you direct (no concentration is needed). If you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create.
tier4: Illusory Selves | (4 Intellect points) | You create four holographic duplicates of yourself within short range. The duplicates last for one minute. You mentally direct their actions, and the duplicates aren’t mirror images—each one can do different things. If struck violently, they either disappear permanently or freeze motionless (your choice). Action to create.
tier5: Terrifying Image | (6 Intellect points) | You use a bit of subtle telepathy to learn which images would appear terrifying to creatures that you choose within long range. Those images appear within that area and menace the appropriate creatures. Make an Intellect attack roll against each creature you want to affect. Success means the creature ﬂees in terror for one minute, pursued by its nightmares. Failure means the creature ignores the images, which do not hamper it in any way. Action.
tier6: Grandiose Illusion | (8 Intellect points) | You create a fantastically complex scene of images that ﬁt within a 1-mile (1.6-km) cube that you are also within. You must be able to see the images when you create them. The images can move in the cube and act in accordance with your desires. They can also act logically (such as reacting appropriately to ﬁre or attacks) when you aren’t directly observing them. The illusion includes sound and smell. For example, armies can clash in battle, with air support from machines or ﬂying creatures, on and above terrain of your creation. The illusion lasts for one hour (or longer, if you concentrate on it after that time). Action.
[Crafts Unique Items]
description: With the remains of previous civilizations all around, the raw materials for a crafter offer themselves to those who know where to look. You are a maker, a crafter, and a builder.
cont_desc: You might start out working with wood or metal as understood by the people of the Ninth World, but eventually you will master even the mysteries of the ancient. Call it magic or technology--you know that you can master it and use it for your own designs.
connection: Pick one other PC. The character has an extra item of regular equipment that you fashioned for her. (She chooses the item).
appearance: You likely carry a wide array of tools and spare parts wherever you go. Your work apron is probably a mainstay of your wardrobe, its pockets and loops brimming with the instruments of your trade. Your calloused fingers might be stained with grease that will never come completely clean, but these marks are badges of honor among your kind.
add_equip: Bag of light tools, the tools needed to make your first-tier crafts and any normal item that you can make with your skills. You also have an extra oddity.
minor_effect: Any rolls you make regarding that artifact gain a +1 bonus for 28 hours.
major_effect: Any rolls you make regarding that artifact gain a +2 bonus for 28 hours.
class_suggestion: nano
tier1: Crafter | You are trained in the crafting of two kinds of items. Enabler. $ Master Identifier | You are trained in identifying the function of any kind of device. Enabler.
tier2: Tinkerer | If you spend at least one day tinkering with an artifact  in your possession, it functions at one level higher than normal. This applies to all artifacts in your possession, but they retain this bonus only for you. Enabler. $ Quick Work | (3 + Intellect points) | One use of any artifact (or one minute of its continuous function) is increased by one level if you use it within the next minute. If you spend 4 additional Intellect points, the use is increased by two levels if you use it within the next minute. Action.
tier3: Master Crafter | You are trained in the crafting of two more kinds of items, or you are specialized in two kinds of items that you are already trained in. Enabler.
tier4: Cyphersmith | All cyphers you use function at one level higher than normal. If given a week and the right tools, chemicals, and parts, you can tinker with one of your cyphers, transforming it into another cypher of the same type (anoetic or occultic) that you had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is logical—for example, you probably can’t transform a pill into a helmet. Enabler.
tier5: Innovator | You can modify any artifact to give it different or better abilities as if that artifact were one level lower than normal, and doing so takes half the normal time to modify a device. Enabler.
tier6: Inventor |  You can create new artifacts in half the time, as if they were two levels lower, by spending half the normal XP. Enabler.
[Employs Magnetism]
description: Electromagnetism is a fundamental force in the universe, and it is yours to command. You are a master of metal.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. Whenever you use your powers, the metallic items on that character's body shudder, rattle, clink, and shake if he is within short range.
appearance: You probably wear a lot of metal, perhaps as part of your clothing or armor, as part of your accessories, embedded into your body surgically, or in some combination of these options.
add_equip: 
minor_effect: The duration of the effect is doubled
major_effect: An important item on the target's person is destroyed
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Move Metal | (1 Intellect point) | You can exert force on metal objects within short range for one round. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a ﬁt, capable, adult human), and you can use it to move metal objects, push against metal objects, and so on. For example, in your round, you could lift and pull a light metal object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). This power lacks the ﬁne control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it’s not a means of attack. You can’t use this ability on your own body. Action.
tier2: Repel Metal | By manipulating magnetism, you are trained in Speed defense tasks against any incoming attack that uses metal. Enabler.
tier3: Destroy Metal | (3 Intellect points) | You instantly tear, rip, or burst a metal object that is within sight, within short range, and no bigger than half your size. Make an Intellect roll to destroy the object; the difﬁculty of this task is decreased by three steps (compared to breaking it with brute strength). Action.
tier4: Magnetic Field | (4 Intellect points) | When you wish it, a ﬁeld of magnetism around you pulls incoming, ranged, metallic projectile attacks (such as arrows, bullets, a thrown metal knife, and so on) to the ground. You are immune to such attacks for one round. You must be aware of an attack to foil it. Enabler.
tier5: Command Metal | (5 Intellect points) | You reshape a metallic item as you desire. The item must be within sight and within short range, and its mass can be no greater than your own. You can affect multiple items at once as long as their combined mass falls within these limits. You can fuse multiple items together. You can use this power to destroy a metal object (as the Destroy Metal ability), or you can craft it into another desired shape (crudely, unless you have the proper crafting skills). You can then move the new object anywhere within range. For example, you could take a few metal shields, fuse them together, and use the resulting shape to block a doorway. You can use this ability to make an attack— causing a foe’s armor to constrict, rendering a metal item into shards that you ﬂing across the battleﬁeld, and so on—against one target within short range. Regardless of the form of the attack, it is an Intellect action that deals 7 points of damage. Action.
tier6: Diamagnetism | You magnetize any nonmetallic object within short range so that it can be affected by your other powers. Thus, with Move Metal, you can move any object. With Repel Metal, you are trained in all Speed defense tasks, regardless of whether the incoming attack uses metal. And so on. Enabler.
[Entertains]
description: You are an entertainer: a singer, dancer, poet, storyteller, or something similar. You perform for the benefit of others.
cont_desc: Naturall charismatic and talented, you have also studied to master your art. You know all the old poems, songs, jokes, and stories, and yo're skilled at creating new ones, too.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character is your worst critic. Your abilities to help or inspire other don't function on her.
appearance: You probably wear flamboyant or at least fashionable clothes and use cosmetics, tattoos, or hair styling for dramatic effect.
add_equip: A musical instrument or other tools needed to perform.
minor_effect: You enchant the target, who remains enchanted as long as your focus all your attention on keeping her that way.
major_effect: The target is forever favorably disposed to you.
class_suggestion: jack
tier1: Levity | Through wit, charm, humor, and grace, you are trained in all social interactions other than those involving coercion or intimidation. During rests, you put friends and comrades at ease so much that they gain +1 to their recovery rolls. Enabler.
tier2: Inspiration | Through stories, songs, art, or other forms of entertainment, you inspire your friends. After spending 28 hours with you, once per day each of your friends can decrease the difﬁculty of a task by one step. This beneﬁt is ongoing while you remain in the friend’s company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the friend’s company within 28 hours. If you leave the friend’s company for more than 28 hours, you must spend another 28 hours together to reactivate the beneﬁt. Enabler.
 tier3: Knowledge | Your stories and songs contain truth. You are trained in two areas of knowledge of your choosing. Enabler.
tier4: Calm | (3 Intellect points) | Through jokes, song, or other art, you prevent a living foe from attacking anyone or anything for one round. Action.
tier5: Able Assistance | When you help someone with a task, you always reduce the difﬁculty of the task by one step regardless of your own skill at that task. Enabler.
tier6: Master Entertainer | Your Inspiration ability works more effectively, allowing your friends to decrease the difﬁculty of a task by two steps rather than one step. Enabler.
[Exists Partially Out of Phase]
description: You have the ability to change your phase state. In fact, you're always slightly out of phase, giving you a ghostly translucence. With concentration, you can pass your hand through a solid object, allow a solid object to pass harmlessly through you, or literally walk through walls.
cont_desc: However, moving in and out of different phase states requires extreme force of will and can be mentally taxing. The explanation for your strange powerl lies with some aspects of the numenera.
connection: Pick one other PC. You have known that PC for a while, and he helped you gain control of your phase states.
appearance: You might do whatever you can to play up your translucent appearance by wearing diaphanous, billowy clothing, or, depending on your personality, you might do just the opposite.
add_equip:
minor_effect: While out of phase, you also gain +1 to all Speed defense tasks
major_effect: While out of phase, you are also invisible.
class_suggestion: jack,nano
tier1: Walks Through Walls | (2 Intellect points) | You can slowly pass through physical barriers at a rate of 1 inch (2.5 cm) per round (minimum of one round to pass through any barrier). You can’t act (other than moving) or perceive anything until you pass entirely through the barrier. You can’t pass through energy barriers. Action.
tier2: Defensive Phasing | (2 Intellect points) | You can change your phase so that some attacks pass through you harmlessly. For the next ten minutes, reduce the difficulty of all your Speed defensive tasks by one step, but during this time you lose any benefit from armor you wear. Action to initiate.
tier3: Phased Attack | (3 Intellect points) | The attack you make on this turn ignores your foe’s armor. The ability works for whatever kind of attack you use (melee, ranged, energy, and so on). Enabler.
tier4: Ghost | (4 Intellect points) | For the next ten minutes, you are trained in sneaking tasks. During this time, you can move through solid barriers (but not energy barriers) at a rate of 1 foot (30 cm) per round, and you can perceive while phased within a barrier or object, which allows you to peek through walls. Action to initiate.
tier5: Untouchable | (6 Intellect points) | You change your phase state for the next one minute so that you can’t affect or be affected by normal matter or energy. Only mental attacks and special transdimensional energies, devices, or abilities can affect you, but likewise you can’t attack, touch, or otherwise affect anything. Action to initiate.
tier6: Enhanced Phased Attack | (5 Intellect points) | This ability works like the third-tier Phased Attack ability except that your attack also disrupts the foe’s vitals, dealing an additional 5 points of damage. Enabler.
[Explores Dark Places]
description: You explore the foreboding ruins and mysterious locales of the ancient eras, trained in such activities by those who have gone before you.
cont_desc: You're the archetypical treasure hunter, scavenger, and finder of lost things. You spend so much of your time in the dark that you slowly adapt to it, almost becoming a creature of the gloom yourself. Even in civilized areas, you prefer to keep to the shadows.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character has been your adventuring partner in previous expeditions, and the two of you work so well together that you both gain +1 to any die rolls when you collaborate on the same task, ﬁght the same foe, and so on.
appearance: Most likely, you wear dark clothing to help you blend into the blackness. On the other hand, you might wear sensible garments and gear because you have serious and dangerous business to attend to in the dark. 
add_equip: An explorer's pack. If you already have one, you can instead take 50 extra feet (15 m) of rope, rations for two more days, and two minor glowglobes
minor_effect: The target is also dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. 
major_effect: The target is also stunned and loses its next turn.
class_suggestion: jack
tier1: Trained Explorer | You are trained in searching, listening, climbing, balancing, and jumping tasks. Enabler.
tier2: Trained Infiltrator | You are trained in lockpicking and tinkering with devices. Enabler. $ Eyes Adjusted | You can see in extremely dim light as though it were bright light. You can see in total darkness as if it were extremely dim. Enabler.
tier3: Slippery Costumer | You are trained in escaping from bonds, ﬁtting in tight spaces, and other contortionist tasks. Thanks to your experience, you also are trained in Speed defense tasks while wearing light armor or no armor. Enabler.
tier4: Resilient | In your explorations of dark places, you’ve been exposed to all sorts of terrible things and are developing a general resistance. You gain +1 to Armor and are trained in Might defense tasks. Enabler.
tier5: Dark Explorer | You ignore penalties for any action (including ﬁghting) in extremely dim light or in cramped spaces. Combined with your Eyes Adjusted ability, you can act without penalty even in total darkness. You are also trained in sneaking tasks while in dim or no light. Enabler.
tier6: Blinding Attack | (3 Speed points) | If you have a source of light, you can use it to make a melee attack against a target. If successful, the attack deals no damage, but the target is blinded for one minute. Action.
[Fights with Panache]
description: You know that style is at least as important as substance. Defeating foes is secondary to looking good while doing it. 
cont_desc: Some might call you a swashbuckler or daredevil. You leap through the air, make a ﬂourish with your weapon, and attack, usually with a clever, biting show of wit. Your enemies hate you, but your allies adore you. Just watching you ﬁght is entertaining. 
connection: Pick one other PC. You're always trying to impress this character with your skill, wit, appearance, or bravado. Perhaps she is a rival, perhaps you need her respect, or perhaps You're romantically interested in her.
appearance: You very likely wear no armor, instead preferring stylish clothing—perhaps even a hat with a feather.
add_equip: A set of extremely stylish clothes and a jeweled weapon.
minor_effect: The target is so dazzled by your style that it is dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment.
major_effect: Make an additional attack with your weapon on your turn.
class_suggestion: jack,glaive
tier1: Attack Flourish | With your attack, you add stylish moves, entertaining quips, or a certain “something” that entertains or impresses others. Choose any number of creatures within short range who can see you; each of them gains a +1 bonus to its next die roll. Enabler.
tier2: Quick Block | If you use a light or medium weapon, you decrease the difﬁculty of your Speed defense actions by one step. Enabler.
tier3: Acrobatic Attack | (3 Speed points) | You leap into the attack, twisting or ﬂipping through the air. This motion decreases the difﬁculty of your attack by one step. If you roll a natural 17 or 18, you can choose to have a minor effect rather than deal extra damage. You can’t use this ability if your Speed is reduced from wearing armor. Enabler.
tier4: Mobile Fighter | (3 Speed points) | As part of your attack, you can leap on or over obstacles, swing from ropes, run along narrow surfaces, or otherwise move around the battleﬁeld at your normal speed as if such tasks were routine (difﬁculty 0). You can’t use this ability if your Speed is reduced from wearing armor. Enabler.
tier5: Block for Another | If you use a light or medium weapon, you can block attacks made against an ally near you. Choose one creature within immediate range. You decrease the difﬁculty of that creature’s Speed defense actions by one step. You can’t use Quick Block while using Block for Another. Enabler.
tier6: Agile Wit | When attempting a Speed task, you instead can roll (and spend points) as if it were an Intellect action. If you apply Effort to this task, you can spend points from your Intellect Pool instead of your Speed Pool (in which case you also use your Intellect Edge instead of your Speed Edge). Enabler.
[Focuses Mind Over Matter]
description: Telekinesis. Psychokinesis. Mind over matter. The power has many names, but in the end, it all boils down to one thing--the molecules that make up all matter are yours to command.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. This character can cause your telekinetic powers to act oddly. Every once in a while, if he stands directly next to you, your powers are cancelled, but at other times, they seem improved when used near him.
appearance: Many telekinetics prefer to wear tight clothing without much accouterment so there is little another TK could grab hold of psychically. On the other hand, you have the power to create very minor telekinetic effects at will, so your hair might always be in motion, you could have a few tiny objects ﬂoating around you, or you might wear a long cape that's always billowing.
add_equip: 
minor_effect: An object moves faster or more efﬁciently.
major_effect: You can move or affect twice as much as normal.
class_suggestion: jack
tier1: Deflect Attacks | (1 Intellect point) | Using your mind, you protect yourself from incoming attacks. For the next ten minutes, you are trained in Speed defense tasks. Action to initiate.
tier2: Telekinesis | (2 Intellect points) | You can exert force on objects within short range. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a ﬁt, capable, adult human), and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). This power lacks the ﬁne control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it’s not a means of attack. You can’t use this ability on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its Might Pool is depleted—whichever comes ﬁrst. Action.
tier3: Enhance Strength | (3 Intellect points) | For the next ten minutes, tasks that depend on brute force— such as moving a heavy object, smashing down a door, or hitting someone with a melee weapon—are easier for you. The difﬁculty of all such tasks is decreased by one step. Action to initiate.
tier4: Apportation | (4 Intellect points) | You call a physical object to you. You can choose any piece of normal equipment on the standard equipment list, or (no more than once per day) you can allow the GM to determine the object randomly. If you call a random object, it has a 10 percent chance of being a cypher or artifact, a 10 percent chance of being an oddity, a 40 percent chance of being a piece of standard equipment, and a 40 percent chance of being a bit of worthless junk. You can’t use this ability to take an item held by another creature. Action.
tier5: Psychokinetic Attack | (5 Intellect points) | You can use this attack in one of two ways. The ﬁrst way is to pick up a heavy object and hurl it at someone within short range. This attack is an Intellect action, and if successful, it deals 6 points of damage to the target and to the hurled object (which could be another foe, although that would require two rolls— one roll to grab the ﬁrst foe and another roll to hit the second foe with the ﬁrst). The second way is to unleash a shattering burst of power that works only against an inanimate object no larger than half your size. Make an Intellect roll to instantly destroy the object; the difﬁculty of this task is decreased by three steps (compared to breaking it with brute strength). Action.
tier6: Reshape Matter | (6 Intellect points) | Your mastery of telekinesis is so great that you can reshape objects on a molecular level. You can affect a single object no larger than you, and the object must be visible and close enough for you to touch. You can use this ability to damage the object (as if using Psychokinetic Attack, except the difﬁculty of the task is decreased by four steps instead of three), or you can attempt a crafting task to reshape the object into another form. Reshaping an object usually has a difﬁculty equal to 1 plus the level of the ﬁnished object.
[Fuses Flesh and Steel]
description: At some point in your past, some of your organic parts were replaced with artiﬁcial components. (Alternatively, you belong to a secret race of biomechanical hybrids.) These artiﬁcial components might be subdermal, or they might resemble more overt metal or synth plating on your skin. They can also take the form of threadlike tendrils of circuitry winding across your ﬂesh.
cont_desc: Whatever their appearance, these components give you special abilities. As you advance, you can add to, modify, or discover new functions for them. Unfortunately, your artiﬁcial body also has special requirements when it takes damage.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character knows your true nature, even if no one else does. If your components are not particularly hidden, she knows a different secret of yours, such as a preprogrammed word that will shut you down for ten minutes.
appearance: You probably wear a cloak with a hood or something similar to hide your artiﬁcial parts from those who would persecute you. Because your components are tricky to repair, as time goes on, it might become more difﬁcult to conceal your true nature, with exposed circuitry, metal plates, and more in a state of partial disassembly.
add_equip: A bag of light tools and a variety of parts to repair yourself.
minor_effect: Your servos learn from your successful actions. You gain a +1 bonus to similar actions involving the same task (such as making attacks against the same foe or operating the same device).
major_effect: You discharge a small pulse of power into your foe. Make an immediate attack against that foe (using the same stat as the action that caused the major effect). If the attack succeeds, it deals 4 points of electrical damage.
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Enhanced Body |  You gain +1 to Armor, +3 to your Might Pool, and +3 to your Speed Pool. Enabler. $ Special Healing | Traditional healing skills, medicines, and techniques work only half as well for you. Each time you start at full health, the ﬁrst 5 points of damage you take can never be healed in these ways or recovered normally. Instead, you must use repairing skills and abilities to restore those points. For example, if you start with a full Might Pool of 10 and take 8 points of damage, you can use recovery rolls to restore 3 points, but the remaining 5 points must be restored using repairing methods.
tier2: Interface | By directly plugging into a device, you can identify and learn to operate it as though the task were one level lower. Enabler.
tier3: Weaponization | One light or medium melee weapon of your choice is built into your body, and you are trained in this weapon (even if you are not trained in other weapons of that type). The weapon is concealed until you wish to use it. Enabler.
tier4: Fusion | You can fuse your cyphers and artifacts with your body. These fused devices function as if they were one level higher. Enabler.
tier5: Deep Reserves |  Once each day, you can transfer up to 5 points between your Pools in any combination, at a rate of 1 point per round. For example, you could transfer 3 points of Might to Speed and 2 points of Intellect to Speed, which would take a total of ﬁve rounds. Action.
tier6: Ultra Enhancement | You gain +1 to Armor and +5 to each of your three stat Pools. Enabler.
[Howls at the Moon]
description: Sometimes the numenera is a double-edged sword. You are cursed and blessed to be able to transform into a powerful creature, drawing additional mass from a transdimensional source.
cont_desc: You and the GM should work out the exact nature of the creature, including its appearance, but it's a wild beast of rage and blood—at least until you learn to control it. Creatures like you are often called “lycanthropes.”
connection: Pick one other PC. That character is able to soothe you when You're in beast form. You'll never attack him while transformed, and if he spends three consecutive turns using his action to calm you down, you can revert to your normal form without having to make a roll.
appearance: Style and appearance are probably low on your list of concerns. Your clothes might be ragged because your transformation is hard on them (or they're cheap because you know they'll be destroyed the next time you transform).
add_equip: An accurate chronometer artifact that always lets you know when the next transformation is coming.
minor_effect: The target is so intimidated by your bestial attack that it is dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. 
major_effect: Your attack conveys a small bit of your lycanthropy. If your foe survives, one month later, he transforms into an uncontrolled beast. The GM decides what happens from there.
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Beast Form | On ﬁve consecutive nights each month, you change into a monstrous beast for up to one hour each night. In this new form, you gain +8 to your Might Pool, +1 to your Might Edge, +2 to your Speed Pool, and +1 to your Speed Edge. While in beast form, you can’t spend Intellect points for any reason other than to try to change to your normal form before the one-hour duration is over (a difﬁculty 2 task). In addition, you attack any and every living creature within short range. After you revert to your normal form, you take a –1 penalty to all rolls for one hour. If you did not kill and eat at least one substantial creature while in beast form, the penalty increases to –2 and affects all your rolls for the next 28 hours. Action to change back.
tier2: Controlled Change | You can try to change into your beast form on any night you wish (a difﬁculty 3 Intellect task). Any transformations you make using this power are in addition to the ﬁve nights per month that you change involuntarily. Action to change.
tier3: Greater Beast Form | Your beast form gains the following additional bonuses: +1 to your Might Edge, +2 to your Speed Pool, and +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler.
tier4: Greater Controlled Change | You no longer change into your beast form unless you want to. Transforming into your beast form or back to your normal form is now a difﬁculty 1 Intellect task. Enabler.
tier5: Enhanced Beast Form | Your beast form gains the following additional bonuses: +3 to your Might Pool, +2 to your Speed Pool, and +2 to Armor. Enabler.
tier6: Perfect Control | You no longer need to make a roll to change into your beast form or your normal form. You can change back and forth as your action. When you return to your normal form, you no longer take a penalty to your rolls. Enabler.
[Hunts with Great Skill]
description: You are a tracker. Perhaps you hunt animals or more deadly creatures. Perhaps you go after people as a bounty hunter, law enforcer, or killer for hire.
cont_desc: Whatever form your hunting takes, you are trained in stalking your quarry and bringing it down. You are a dangerous individual.
connection: Pick one other PC. That person once saw you show surprising mercy toward your prey, and now you hope she keeps that information quiet—it might harm your reputation.
appearance: If you hunt animals or creatures, you might carry the trophies of past kills, such as teeth or skins. If You're a bounty hunter, you probably wear whatever your quarry would ﬁnd most intimidating so it feels as though it has no chance of getting away from you.
add_equip: Boots that mufﬂe your footsteps, giving you a +1 bonus to any roll made involving sneaky movement.
minor_effect: You can attempt an intimidating task to cause your foe to immediately surrender.
major_effect: Your foe pauses, terriﬁed by your prowess, and takes no action on his turn.
class_suggestion: glaive
tier1: Tracker | You are trained in following and identifying tracks. Enabler. $ Stalker | You are trained in all types of movement tasks (including climbing, swimming, jumping, and balancing) Enabler.
tier2: Sneak | You are trained in stealh and initiative tasks. Enabler. $ Sprint and Grab | (2 Speed points) | You can run a short distance and make a melee attack to grab a foe of your size or smaller. A successful attack means you grab the foe and bring it to a halt if it was moving (this can be treated as a tackle, if appropriate). Action.
tier3: Quarry | (2 Intellect points) | Choose a quarry (a single individual creature that you can see). You are trained in all tasks involving following, understanding, interacting with, or ﬁghting that creature. You can have only one quarry at a time. Action to initiate.
tier4: Surprise Attack | If attacking from a hidden vantage, with surprise, or before your opponent has acted, you decrease the difﬁculty of your attack by one step. On a successful hit, you inﬂict 2 additional points of damage. Enabler.
tier5: Hunter's Drive | (5 Intellect points) | Through force of will, when you wish it, you grant yourself greater prowess in the hunt for ten minutes. During this time, you decrease the difﬁculty of all tasks involving your quarry, including attacks, by one step. Your quarry is the creature you selected with your third-tier ability. Enabler.
tier6: Multiple Quarry | (6 Intellect points) | This ability functions like the third-tier Quarry ability except that you can select up to three creatures as quarry. You must be able to see all three creatures when you initiate this ability. Your Hunter’s Drive ability applies to all three creatures. Action to initiate.
[Leads]
description: Using charisma, natural leadership, and perhaps some training, you command the actions of others, who follow you willingly.
cont_desc: You are a commander, a captain, a leader, or a general. Your skills allow you to make people do what you want, but you also have the wisdom to know what actions would be best for your followers and allies. 
connection: Pick one other PC. That character was once a follower of yours, but you have since grown to think of him as a peer.
appearance: Since you need the respect of others, you probably dress and carry yourself in such a way that inspires, endears, or intimidates. You have a voice suited to barking orders that can be heard even on a noisy battleﬁeld.
add_equip: Artifact that allows you to tag up to seven followers. By looking into the glass plate on the device, you can determine their distance and direction relative to you. The tagging process is somewhat demeaning, so it is likely that only your followers would ever submit to it.
minor_effect: The next time you attempt to command, captivate, or otherwise inﬂuence the same foe, the difﬁculty of the task is decreased by one step. 
major_effect: The foe is inﬂuenced, captivated, or otherwise affected by your ability for twice as long as normal.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
tier1: Natural Charisma | You are trained in all social interactions, whether they involve charm, learning a person’s secrets, or intimidating others. Enabler. $ Good Advice | (1 Intellect point) | You have a clear mind for determining the best way to proceed. When you give another character a suggestion involving his next action, the character is trained in that action for one round. Action.
tier2: Follower | You gain a level 2 NPC follower who is completely devoted to you. You and the GM must work out the details of the follower and you’ll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The follower acts on your turn. As a level 2 follower, it has a target number of 6 and a health of 6, and it inﬂicts 2 points of damage. If the follower dies, you gain a new one after at least two weeks and proper recruitment. Enabler.
tier3: Command | (3 Intellect points) | Through sheer force of will and charisma, you issue a simple command to a single living creature, which attempts to carry out your command as its next action. The creature must be within short range and be able to understand you. The command can’t inﬂict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so “Commit suicide” won’t work, but “Flee” might. In addition, the command can require the creature to take only one action, so “Open the door” might work, but “Open the door and run through it” won’t. Action. $ Capable Follower | Your ﬁrst follower increases to level 3. As a level 3 follower, it has a target number of 9 and a health of 9, and it inﬂicts 3 points of damage. Enabler.
tier4: Captivate or Inspire | (4 Intellect points) | You can use this ability in one of two ways. Either your words keep the attention of all NPCs that hear them for as long as you speak, or your words inspire all NPCs (of your choosing) that hear them to function as if they were one level higher for the next hour. Action. $ Capable Follower | Your ﬁrst follower increases to level 4. As a level 4 follower, it has a target number of 12 and a health of 12, and it inﬂicts 4 points of damage. Enabler.
tier5: Band of Followers | You gain six level 2 NPC followers who are completely devoted to you. (They are in addition to the follower you gained at second tier.) You and the GM must work out the details of these followers. If a follower dies, you gain a new one after at least two weeks and proper recruitment. Enabler.
tier6: Mind of a Leader | (6 Intellect points) | When you develop a plan that involves your followers, you can ask the GM one very general question about what is likely to happen if you carry out the plan, and you will get a simple, brief answer. Action. $ Capable Followers | Your ﬁrst follower increases to level 5. As a level 5 follower, it has a target number of 15 and a health of 15, and it inﬂicts 5 points of damage. Each of your level 2 followers increases to level 3. Enabler.
[Lives in the Wilderness]
description: You dwell in the wilds. You probably have done so most, if not all, of your life, coming to understand the mysteries of nature, weather, and survival. The ways of ﬂora and fauna are your ways.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC who isn't from the wilderness. You can't help but feel a little contempt for that character and her “civilized” ways, which show disdain for all things natural and (to your mind) true. 
appearance: Your rough, rugged clothing shows little concern for style. Most of the time, covering yourself in natural smells to keep your scent from arousing suspicion in the wilderness is more important than bathing to keep yourself presentable to other humans.
add_equip: A directional compass.
minor_effect: A foe that is a natural creature ﬂees rather than continue to ﬁght you. 
major_effect: A foe that is a natural creature becomes warily passive.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
tier1: Wilderness Life | You are trained in climbing and swimming tasks. Enabler. $ Wilderness Lore | You are trained in wilderness navigation and in identifying plants and creatures. Enabler.
tier2: Living off the Land | Given an hour or so, you can always ﬁnd edible food and potable water in the wilderness. You can even ﬁnd enough for a small group of people, if need be. Further, since you’re so hardy and have gained resistance over time, the difﬁculty of resisting the effects of natural poisons (such as those from plants or living creatures) is decreased by one step. You’re also immune to natural diseases. Enabler.
tier3: Animal Senses and Sensibilities | You are trained in listening and spotting things. In addition, most of the time, the GM should alert you if you’re about to walk into an ambush or a trap that is lower than level 3. Enabler. $ Wilderness Explorer | While taking any action (including ﬁghting) in the wild, you ignore any penalties due to natural causes such as tall grass, thick brush, rugged terrain, weather, and so on. Enabler.
tier4: Wilderness Awareness | (4 Intellect points) | Your connection to the natural world extends to a degree that some would call supernatural. While in the wilderness, you can extend your senses up to a mile in any direction and ask the GM a very simple, general question about that area, such as “Where is the margr camp?” or “Is my friend Deithan still alive?” If the answer you seek is not in the area, you receive no information. Action.
tier5: The Wild is on your Side | (5 Intellect points) | While you’re in the wilderness, foes within short range are tripped by rocks, tangled in vines, bitten by insects, and distracted or confused by small animals. The difﬁculty of any tasks performed by those foes is increased by one step. This effect lasts for ten minutes. Action to initiate.
tier6: One With the Wild | (6 Intellect points) | For the next ten minutes, natural animals and plants within long range will not knowingly harm you or those you designate. Action. $ Master of the Wild | While you’re in the wilderness, your Might Edge, Speed Edge, and Intellect Edge increase by 1. When you make a recovery roll in the wilderness, you recover twice as many points. Enabler.
[Masters Defense]
description: Protecting yourself is obviously important in dangerous situations, and you are particularly good at it. 
cont_desc: Cautious and prudent, you learn techniques to defend against all kinds of attacks, both physical and mental. The winner is often the last person standing, and you've done all you can to ensure that person will be you. 
connection: Pick one other PC. This character protected you from harm recently, and you feel indebted to him for saving your life.
appearance: You carry a shield and probably wear the best armor you can ﬁnd.
add_equip: A shield.
minor_effect: You gain a +1 bonus to Speed defense rolls for one round.
major_effect: You gain a +2 bonus to Speed defense rolls for one round.
class_suggestion: glaive
tier1: Shield Master | When you use a shield, in addition to the asset it gives you (lowering the difﬁculty of Speed defense tasks by one step), you can act as if you are trained in Speed defense tasks. However, in any round in which you use this beneﬁt, the difﬁculty of your attacks increases by one step. Enabler.
tier2: Sturdy | You are trained in Might defense tasks. Enabler. $ Armor Expert | When you wear any armor, you reduce the armor’s penalties (Might cost per hour and Speed reduction) by 1. Enabler.
tier3: Dodge and Resist | (3 Speed points) | You can reroll any of your Might, Speed, or Intellect defensive rolls and take the better of the two results. Enabler.
tier4: Tower of Will | You are trained in Intellect defense tasks. Enabler. $ Armor Master |  When you wear any armor, you reduce the armor’s penalties (Might cost per hour and Speed reduction) to 0. Enabler.
tier5: Nothing but Defend | If you do nothing on your turn other than defend, you are specialized in all defensive tasks for that one round. Action.
tier6: Defense Master | Every time you succeed at a Speed defense task, you can make an immediate attack against your foe. Your attack must be the same type (melee weapon, ranged weapon, or unarmed) as the attack you defend against. If you don’t have an appropriate type of weapon ready, you can’t use this ability. Enabler.
[Masters Weaponry]
description: You have worked long and hard with one particular type of weapon: swords, axes, daggers, whips, or whatever you choose.
cont_desc: Thus, you are a swordsman, an axemaster, a mistress of knives, or whatever is appropriate to your chosen weapon. A master of the rapier is different from a master of the warhammer. 
connection: Pick one other PC. That character shows potential in the use of your weapon. You would like to train her, but You're not necessarily qualiﬁed to teach (that's up to you), and she might not be interested (that's up to her).
appearance: You might wear a symbol—a badge, a pin, a tattoo, an amulet, certain colors, and so on—that indicates the school in which you trained, the style of ﬁghting you have mastered, or the name of your mentor. Your weapon is almost certainly your ﬁnest possession. Not only is it well cared for and of high quality, but you probably keep it in a beautiful scabbard, harness, belt, case, or something similar. 
add_equip: A high-quality weapon of your choosing. 
minor_effect: The target is so dazzled by your expertise that it is dazed for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment.
major_effect: Make an immediate additional attack with the weapon as part of your turn.
class_suggestion: glaive
tier1: Weapon Master | You gain a +1 bonus to damage with your chosen weapon. Enabler.
tier2: Weapon Defense | While your chosen weapon is in your hand or hands, you are trained in Speed defense rolls. Enabler.
tier3: Rapid Attack | (3 Speed points) | Once per round, you can make an additional attack with your chosen weapon. Enabler.
tier4: Never Fumble | If you roll a natural 1 when attacking with your chosen weapon, you can ignore or countermand the GM’s intrusion for that roll. You can never be disarmed of your chosen weapon, nor will you ever drop it accidentally. Enabler.
tier5: Extreme Mastery | (4 Might points) | When using your chosen weapon, you can reroll any attack roll you wish and take the better of the two results. Enabler.
tier6: Damage Dealer | You gain a +2 bonus to damage with your chosen weapon. This bonus adds to the one from the Weapon Master ability, giving you a total bonus of +3. Enabler. $ Death Dealer | (5 Might points) | If you strike a foe of level 3 or less with your chosen weapon, you kill the target instantly. Action.
[Murders]
description: The murderous assassin is a master of dealing death. No one is better at sneaking into a location, eliminating a target, and slipping out again. Obviously, a professional killer is not likely to have a lot of friends. 
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. That character knows your real identity, profession, and background. To all others, the truth about you is a closely guarded secret.
appearance: You probably wear dark colors—black, charcoal grey, or midnight blue—to help blend into the shadows. But since You're also a master of disguise, in truth you could look like anyone.
add_equip: A disguise kit and three doses of a level 2 blade poison that inﬂicts 5 points of damage.
minor_effect: No one but the foe notices that you make the attack.
major_effect: If you have poison amid your belongings, you were able to apply it just before the strike, adding the poison's effects to the normal attack damage.
class_suggestion: all
tier1: Surprise Attack |  If attacking from a hidden vantage, with surprise, or before an opponent has acted, you reduce the difﬁculty of your attack by one step. On a successful hit with this surprise attack, you inﬂict 2 additional points of damage. Enabler. $ Trained Assassin | You are trained in stealth and disguise tasks. Enabler.
tier2: Quick Death | (2 Speed points) | You know how to kill quickly. When you hit with a melee or ranged attack, you deal 4 additional points of damage. You can’t make this attack in two consecutive rounds. Action.
tier3: Poison Crafter | You are trained in crafting sensing, identifying, and resisting poisons. Enabler. $ Trained Infiltrator | You are trained in all interactions involving trickery or lies. Enabler.
tier4: Better Surprise Attack | If attacking from a hidden vantage, with surprise, or before an opponent has acted, you reduce the difﬁculty of your attack by one step. On a successful hit with this surprise attack, you inﬂict 2 additional points of damage. These effects add to those from Surprise Attack, giving you a total decrease of two steps and a total of 4 additional points of damage. Enabler.
tier5: Slayer | (5 Speed points) | With a swift and sudden attack, you strike a foe in a vital spot. If the target is level 3 or less, it is slain outright. Action.
tier6: Escape Plan | When you kill a foe, you can attempt a sneaking action to immediately hide from anyone around, assuming that a suitable hiding place is nearby. Enabler.
[Rages]
description: The berserker is a feared ﬁghter who cannot be stopped. You put yourself into a howling battle frenzy that can make you a terror on the battleﬁeld. You might hail from a less civilized society, perhaps even a tribal one. 
cont_desc:
connection: Choose one other PC. You feel strangely protective toward that character and don't want to see her come to harm. 
appearance: You likely wear little or no armor so as not to restrict your speed or maneuverability. Your clothing is probably simple and utilitarian. 
add_equip: 
minor_effect: When ﬁghting multiple foes, you knock one into another, putting both off balance. As a result, treat both foes as one level lower for one round. 
major_effect:  Your foe is terriﬁed of your rage and uses his next two actions to ﬂee.
class_suggestion: glaive
tier1: Frenzy | (1 Intellect point) | When you wish, while in combat, you can enter a state of frenzy. While in this state, you can’t use Intellect points, but you gain +1 to your Might Edge and your Speed Edge. This effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking place within range of your senses. Enabler.
tier2: Hardy | You gain +5 to your Might Pool. These additional points can be used only to absorb damage. You can’t spend them to apply Effort to rolls. Enabler. $ Mobile Fighter | You are trained in climbing and jumping tasks. Enabler.
tier3: Power Strike | (3+ Might points) | If you successfully attack a target, you knock it prone in addition to inﬂicting damage. The target must be your size or smaller. You can knock down a target larger than you if you apply a level of Effort to do so (rather than to decrease the difﬁculty of the attack). Enabler. $ Unarmored Fighter | While unarmored, you are trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler.
tier4: Greater Frenzy | (4 Intellect points) | When you wish, while in combat, you can enter a state of frenzy. While in this state, you can’t use Intellect points, but you gain +2 to your Might Edge and your Speed Edge. This effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking place within range of your senses. You can use this ability or your ﬁrst-tier Frenzy ability, but you can’t use both at the same time. Enabler.
tier5: Attack and Attack Again | Rather than granting additional damage or a minor or major effect, a natural 17 or higher on your attack roll allows you the option of immediately making another attack. Enabler.
tier6: Tough and Fast | You gain +6 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool. Enabler.
[Rides the Lightning]
description: The ancients harnessed electricity in strange and wonderful ways. Through practice and inherent ability (or the subtle use of hidden or implanted devices), you control the same energy.
cont_desc: Not only can you create and discharge electrical power, but you can eventually learn to use it to transport yourself.
connection: Pick one other PC. This character has been your friend for a long time, and you have learned to bring her along when you ride the lightning. If the character is standing right next to you, you can take her with you when you use the Bolt Rider or Electrical Flight powers. (Normally, neither ability allows you to transport other creatures.) 
appearance: You probably wear tight-ﬁtting clothing that allows you to move quickly. Your garments might be blue and black, perhaps with a lightning-bolt motif.
add_equip: A bag of miscellaneous batteries and power cells. Whenever you ﬁnd a new device that operates on batteries or cells (GM discretion), there is a 75 percent chance that the bag contains one that will power it if it depletes.
minor_effect: The target is dazed by electricity for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. Electricity can also shut down an android, robot, or other automaton for one round.
major_effect:  Devices killed with electrical power explode. You can target and destroy an artifact that a foe is holding or wearing.
class_suggestion: nano,jack
tier1: Shock | (1 Intellect point) | Your hands crackle with electricity, and the next time you touch a creature, you inﬂict 3 points of damage. Alternatively, if you wield a weapon, for ten minutes it crackles with electricity and inﬂicts 1 additional point of damage per attack. Action for touch; enabler for weapon. $ Charge | (1+ Intellect points) | You can charge an artifact or other device (except a cypher) so that it can be used once. The cost is 1 Intellect point plus 1 point per level of the device. Action.
tier2: Bolt Rider | (4 Intellect points) | You can move a long distance from one location to another almost instantaneously, carried by a bolt of lightning. You must be able to see the new location, and there must be no intervening barriers. Action.
tier3: Lightning Swift | You gain +3 to your Speed Pool and +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler. $ Drain Charge | You can drain the power from an artifact or device, allowing you to regain 1 Intellect point per level of the device. You regain points at the rate of 1 point per round and must give your full concentration to the process each round. The GM determines whether the device is fully drained (likely true of most handheld or smaller devices) or retains some power (likely true of large machines). Action to initiate; action each round to drain.
tier4: Bolts of Power | (5+ Intellect points) | You blast a fan of lightning out to short range in an arc that is approximately 50 feet (15 m) wide at the end. This discharge inﬂicts 4 points of damage. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than to decrease the difﬁculty, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); however, targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action.
tier5: Electrical Flight | (5 Intellect points) | You exude an aura of crackling electricity that lets you ﬂy for ten minutes. You can’t carry other creatures with you. Action to activate.
tier6: Wall of Lightning | (6 Intellect points) | You create a barrier of crackling electricity up to 2,500 square feet (230 sq. m) in size, shaped as you wish. The wall is a level 7 barrier. Anyone within immediate distance of the wall automatically takes 10 points of damage. The wall lasts for one hour. Action to create.
[Talks to Machines]
description: Since you were young, you had an afﬁnity for machines. It seemed almost like you were speaking to them.
cont_desc: You were. You have the ability to use your organic brain like a computer, interfacing “wirelessly” with any electronic device. You can control and inﬂuence them in ways that others can't. Computers are your friends and companions. You have also learned to repair machines of all kinds because the better they work, the better off you are as well.
connection: Pick one other PC. That character seems to have a terrible relationship with machines—or at least the machines that you communicate with. If she is next to a machine that you interact with in a friendly manner, that machine is treated in all ways as being one level lower than normal (unless doing so beneﬁts you or her, in which case the level does not change). 
appearance: You likely wear a tool belt full of various implements, and machine oils stain your clothes and ﬁngertips.
add_equip: A bag of small tools. 
minor_effect: The duration of inﬂuence or control is doubled.
major_effect: The duration of inﬂuence or control becomes 28 hours.
class_suggestion: nano
tier1: Machine Affinity | You are trained in all tasks involving electrical machines. Enabler. $ Distant Activation | (1 Intellect point) | You can activate or deactivate any machine you can see within short range, even if normally you would have to touch or manually operate the device. To use this ability, you must understand the function of the machine, it must be your size or smaller, and it can’t be connected to another intelligence (or be intelligent itself). Action.
tier2: Coaxing Power | (2 Intellect points) | You boost the power or function of a machine so that it operates at one level higher than normal for one hour. Action to initiate. $ Charm Machine | (2 Intellect points) | You convince an unintelligent machine to “like” you. A machine that likes you is 50 percent less likely to function if said function would cause you harm. Thus, if a foe attempts to detonate a bomb near you controlled by a detonator that likes you, there is a 50 percent chance that it won’t explode. Action to initiate.
tier3: Intelligent Interface | (3 Intellect points) | You can speak telepathically with any intelligent machine within long range. Further, you are trained in all interactions with intelligent machines. Such machines and automatons that normally would never communicate with a human might talk to you. Enabler.
tier4: Machine Companion | You create a level 3 animate, intelligent machine that accompanies you and acts as you direct. As a level 3 machine companion, it has a target number of 9 and a health of 9, and it inﬂicts 3 points of damage. If it’s destroyed, it takes you one month to create a new one. Enabler. $ Robot Fighter |  When ﬁghting an automaton or intelligent machine, you are trained in attacks and defense. Enabler.
tier5: Information Gathering | (5 Intellect points) | You speak telepathically with any or all machines within 1 mile (1.6 km). You can ask one basic question about themselves or anything happening near them and receive a simple answer. For example, while in an area with many machines, you could ask “Where is the ravage bear?” and if the creature is within a mile of you, one or more machines will probably provide the answer. Action.
tier6: Control Machine | (6 Intellect points) | You can control the functions of any machine, intelligent or otherwise, within short range. This effect lasts ten minutes. Action.
[Wears a Sheen of Ice]
description: Through your studies, you have learned to focus your natural talents to command the powers of ice and cold. People might refer to you as an ice mage.
cont_desc: Sometimes ice mages are thought to come into conﬂict with those known as ﬁre mages, but this is a fallacy believed by ordinary folks more than anything based in truth. 
connection: Pick one other PC. Due to a quirk of the numenera, if that character is standing next to you when you use your Ice Armor ability, he is also protected by a sheen of ice. (He does not get the added protection of your Resilient Ice Armor ability.)
appearance: You likely wear white or blue garments that are heavier than they need to be—unless you live in a cold region or wintry clime, in which case you probably wear less clothing than other people do because the cold doesn't bother you.
add_equip: A bladed weapon made of stronglass that looks like ice.
minor_effect: The surface around the target becomes slick and difﬁcult to stand on. 
major_effect: The target is covered in ice that hinders its movement for one minute, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment.
class_suggestion: nano
tier1: Ice Armor | (1 Intellect point) | When you wish it, your body is covered in a sheen of ice for ten minutes that gives you +1 to Armor. While the sheen is active, you feel no discomfort from normal cold temperatures and have an additional +2 to Armor versus cold damage speciﬁcally. Enabler.
tier2: Frost Touch | (1 Intellect point) | Your hands become so cold that the next time you touch a creature, you inﬂict 3 points of damage. Alternatively, you can use this ability on a weapon, and for ten minutes, it inﬂicts 1 additional point of damage from the cold. Action for touch; enabler for weapon.
tier3: Freezing Touch | (4 Intellect points) | Your hands become so cold that, in addition to inﬂicting damage as described under Frost Touch, your touch freezes solid a living target of your size or smaller, rendering it immobile for one round. Action.
tier4: Resilient Ice Armor | The sheen of ice you generate using you Ice Armor ability gives you an additional +1 to Armor. Enabler.
tier5: Cold Burst | (5+ Intellect points) | You emit a blast of cold in all directions, up to short range. All within the burst take 5 points of damage. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than to decrease the difﬁculty, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); however, targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action.
tier6: Ice Creation | (6 Intellect points) | You create a solid object of ice that is your size or smaller. The object is crude and can have no moving parts, so you can make a sword, a shield, a short ladder, and so on. Your ice objects are as strong as iron, but if you’re not in constant contact with them, they function for only 1d6 + 6 rounds before breaking or melting. For example, you can make and wield an ice sword, but if you give it to another PC, the sword won’t last as long for that character. Action.
[Wields Power with Precision]
description: Not only are you blessed with a great command of the numenera, but you are also trained to exploit esoteries in ways that elevate you above other nanos and jacks.
cont_desc: Some people believe that those who perform esoteries are born with the ability, but you know that skill and intelligence play important roles. The ancients created the numenera through knowledge, discovery, and intellect, and to use it properly, you must follow the same path. 
connection:  Pick one other PC. You've placed an immutable, one-time ward that renders her immune to the esoteries you perform unless she wants to be affected. 
appearance: You probably wear spectacles and dapper outﬁts, carrying extra books, notebooks, and pens so you can continually focus on your studies and experiments. 
add_equip: An additional book on the subject of the numenera
minor_effect: The esotery overwhelms and dazzles the target for one round, during which time the difﬁculty of all tasks it performs is modiﬁed by one step to its detriment. 
major_effect: The esotery terriﬁes the target, who uses its next two turns to ﬂee.
class_suggestion: nano
tier1: Genius | Your Intellect Pool increases by 5 points. Enabler
tier2: Training and Precision | You are trained in all esoteries. As a result, you reduce the difficulty of any task involved in the use of an esotery by one step. Enabler.
tier3: Enhanced Esoteries | Your esoteries that have durations last twice as long. Your esoteries that have short ranges reach to long range instead. Your esoteries that inﬂict damage deal 1 additional point of damage. Enabler.
tier4: Greater Repertoire | You can learn one additional esotery of fourth tier or lower. Enabler.
tier5: Greater Training | You are specialized in all esoteries. As a result, you reduce the difﬁculty of any task involved in the use of an esotery by two steps. Enabler.
tier6: Supra-Genius | Your Intellect Pool increased by 5, and your Intellect Edge increases by 1. Enabler.
[Wields Two Weapons at Once]
description: You bear steel with both hands, ready to take on any foe. You ﬁght with two weapons in melee, sometimes called dual wielding. A fearsome warrior, quick and strong, you believe that the best defense is a strong offense.
cont_desc: 
connection: Pick one other PC. You have trained with this character so much that if the two of you stand back to back in a ﬁght, you both gain a +1 bonus to Speed defense tasks.
appearance: You probably sheathe one weapon on each side or both crossed behind your back. They are likely your most prized possessions, and you might have names for them.
add_equip: An additional light melee weapon.
minor_effect: The target is intimidated and ﬂees as its next action. 
major_effect: You can make an immediate additional attack with one of your weapons.
class_suggestion: glaive,jack
tier1: Dual Light Wield | You can use two light weapons at the same time, making two separate attacks on your turn as a single action. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action, but because you make separate attacks, your opponent’s Armor applies to both. Anything that modiﬁes your attack or damage applies to both attacks, unless it’s speciﬁcally tied to one of the weapons. Enabler.
tier2: Double Strike | (3 Might points) | When you wield two weapons, you can choose to make one attack roll against a foe. If you hit, you inﬂict damage with both weapons plus 2 additional points of damage, and because you made a single attack, the target’s Armor is subtracted only once. Action.
tier3: Dual Medium Wield | You can use two light weapons or medium weapons at the same time (or one light weapon and one medium weapon), making two separate attacks on your turn as a single action. This ability otherwise works like the Dual Light Wield ability. Enabler.
tier4: Dual Defense | When you wield two weapons, you are trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler.
tier5: Dual Distraction | (4 Speed points) | When you wield two weapons, your opponent’s next attack is hindered. As a result, the difﬁculty of your defense roll against that attack is reduced by one step, and the difﬁculty of your next attack is reduced by one step. Enabler.
tier6: Whirling Dervish | When you wield two weapons, you can attack up to six times in one round as a single action, but you must make each attack against a different foe. Make a separate attack roll for each attack. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action, but because you make separate attacks, Armor applies to each of them. Anything that modiﬁes your attack or damage applies to all attacks (positively or negatively), unless it’s speciﬁcally tied to one of the weapons, in which case it applies to only half of the attacks. Enabler.
[Works Miracles]
description: You manipulate matter and time to help others and are beloved by everyone you encounter. Some people consider you a representative of the gods or a power from beyond this world.
cont_desc: Perhaps they're right-transdimensional experiments in the prior worlds might be what created the energies that you now wield. 
connection: Pick one other PC. This character quietly suspects that You're a messiah or supernatural being. You can choose whether or not You're aware of his suspicion. 
appearance: You probably wear simple clothes—nothing too ﬂashy or stylish. There's no need to call more attention to yourself.
add_equip: 
minor_effect: The target is healed for 1 additional point. 
major_effect: The target is healed for 2 additional points.
class_suggestion: nano 
tier1: Healing Touch | (1 Intellect point) | With a touch, you restore 1d6 points to one stat Pool of any creature. This ability is a difﬁculty 2 Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal the same creature, the task difﬁculty increases by one step. The difﬁculty returns to 2 after that creature rests for ten hours. Action.
tier2: Alleviate | (3 Intellect points) | You attempt to cancel or cure on malady (such as disease or poison) in one creature. Action.
tier3: Font of Healing | With your approval, other creatures can touch you and regain 1d6 points to either their Might Pool or their Speed Pool. This healing costs them 2 Intellect points. A single creature can beneﬁt from this ability only once each day. Enabler.
tier4: Inspiration | (4 Intellect points) | Through mental inspiration and the manipulation of time, one creature you choose within short range is granted an additional, immediate action, which it can take out of turn. Action.
tier5: Undo | (5 Intellect points) | You turn back time a few seconds, effectively undoing a single creature’s most recent action. That creature can then immediately repeat the same action or try something different. Action.
tier6: Greater Healing Touch | (4 Intellect points) | You touch a creature and restore its Might Pool, Speed Pool, and Intellect Pool to their maximum values, as if it were fully rested. A single creature can beneﬁt from this ability only once each day. Action.
[Works with Back Alleys]
description: The thief, the burglar, the pickpocket: these are the dangerous individuals who haunt the back alleys of every community. You are a thief in a city or town, making your livelihood at the expense of the wealthy.
cont_desc: Your talents, however, prepare you for all kinds of pursuits, even when You're not crouching in an alley or climbing into a window. 
connection:  Pick one other PC. The character knew you beforehand and convinced you to leave your life of crime for other pursuits—at least temporarily
appearance: Usually, you dress to blend in with the crowd. When You're on a mission, black, form-ﬁtting clothing allows you to swim in the shadows
add_equip: A bag of light tools
minor_effect: You can immediately attempt to hide after this action. 
major_effect: You can immediately take a second action during this turn.
class_suggestion: jack
tier1: Thief | You are trained in sneaking, pickpocketing, and lockpicking tasks. Enabler.
tier2: Underworld Contacts | You know many people in a variety of communities who engage in illegal activities. These people are not necessarily your friends and might not be trustworthy, but they recognize you as a peer. You and the GM should work out the details of your underworld contacts. Enabler.
tier3: Pull a Fast One | (3 Intellect points) | When you’re running a con, picking a pocket, fooling or tricking a dupe, sneaking something by a guard, and so on, you treat the task as if it were one level lower. Enabler.
tier4: Master Thief | You are trained in climbing, escaping from bonds, slipping through narrow places, and other contortionist moves. Enabler.
tier5: Dirty Fighter | (2 Speed points) | You distract, blind, annoy, hamper, or otherwise interfere with a foe, hindering his attack and defense rolls for one minute. As a result, the difﬁculty of your defense rolls and attack rolls against the foe is reduced by one step. Action.
tier6: Alley Rat | (4 Intellect points) | While in a city, you ﬁnd or create a signiﬁcant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where it looked like none existed. You and the GM should work out the details. Action.
