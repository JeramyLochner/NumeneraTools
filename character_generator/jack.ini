[Tier1_moves]
Bash: (1 Might Point) | This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal, but dazes your target for one round, during which time the difficulty of all tasks it performs is modi?ed by one step to its detriment. 
Pierce: (1 Speed Point) | This is a well-aimed, penetrating ranged attack. You make an attack and in?ict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a sharp point. Action. 
Thrust: (1 Might Point) | This is a powerful melee stab. You make an attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a sharp edge or point. Action. 
Trained Without Armor: You are trained in Speed defense actions when not wearing armor. Enabler
Hedge Magic: (1 Intellect point) You can perform small tricks: temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to ?oat through the air, clean a small area, mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) food, and so on. You can't use hedge magic to harm another creature or object. Action
Practiced In Armor:  Jacks can wear armor for reasonable periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Might cost per hour for wearing armor and the Speed Pool reduction for wearing armor by 2. Enabler
Skill With Defense: Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. Unlike most tricks of the trade, you can select this trick up to three times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of defense task. Enabler
[Tier2_moves]
Brute Finesse: Sometimes a swift kick is just the trick to popping open a lock or starting a reluctant piece of machinery. When you apply Effort to a noncombat Speed task, you can spend points from your Might Pool as if they came from your Speed Pool. For example, you could spend 3 Might points and 2 Speed points to apply two levels of Effort to picking a lock. Enabler. 
Experienced Adventurer: When you use a noncombat skill successfully, if you didn't roll a natural 19 or 20, you can apply a level of Effort (after the roll) to get a minor special effect. The stat points spent for this level of Effort must come from the same stat as the one used for the skill. Thus, if you made a Speed roll, the cost of the Effort comes from your Speed Pool. Applying the Effort doesn't modify the difficulty of the task—it only creates the minor effect. Enabler.
No Need for Weapons: When you make an unarmed attack (such as a punch or kick), it counts as a medium weapon instead of a light weapon. Enabler.
Push: (2 Intellect points) | You push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For Example, you can't use this esotery to pull a level or even close a door. Action.
Reload: (1 Speed point) | When using a weapon that normally requires an action to reload, such as a heavy crossbow, you can reload and fire (or fire and reload) in the same action. Enabler. 
Ward: You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps de?ect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler.
[Tier3_moves]
Enhancement: (4 Intellect points) | You gain a +1 bonus to the Edge for one stat of your choice (Might, Speed, or Intellect) for ten minutes. You can have only one versio of this trick in effect at a time. Action to initiate.
Hover: (3 Intellect points) | You float slowly into the air. If you concentrate, you can control your movement to remain motionless in the air, or ?oat up to a short distance as your action, but no more; otherwise, you drift with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts for up to ten minutes. Action to initiate.
Mind Reading: (4 Intellect points) | You can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range of you, even if the target doesn't want you to. You must be able to see the target. Once you have established contact, you can read the target’s thoughts for up to one minute. If you or the target move out of range, the connection is broken. Action to initiate.
Onslaught: (2 Intellect points) | You attack a foe using energies that assail either his physical form or his mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a short-range, invisible ray of force that in?icts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice in?icts 2 points of Intellect damage (and thus ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such as automatons) might be immune to mindslice. Action. 
Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. Enabler.
[Tier4_moves]
Analytical Combat: Sometimes the most important muscle in a ?ght is your brain. If you can predict where an opponent will move next or see her weak spot, you can be a more successful combatant. When you apply Effort to a combat Might task or Speed task, you can also spend points from your Intellect Pool as if they came from your Might Pool or Speed Pool. For example, you could spend 3 Intellect points and 2 Might points to apply two levels of Effort to attacking with a sword. Enabler. 
Lunge: (2 Might points) | This move requires you to extend yourself for a powerful stab or smash. The awkward lunge increases the difficulty of the attack roll by one step. If your attack is successful, it in?icts 4 additional points of damage. Action. 
Slice: (2 Speed points) | This is a quick attack with a bladed or pointed weapon that is hard to defend against. The difficulty of the attack roll is decreased by one step. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. Action
Spray: (2 Speed points) | If a weapon has the ability to ?re rapid shots without reloading(usually called a rapid-?re weapon, such as the crank crossbow), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This move uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). The difficulty of the attack roll is decreased by one step. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. Action. 
Transdimensional Weapon: ( 3 Intellect points) | One melee weapon that you touch vibrates on a dimensional frequency so that it spans into other dimensions for one hour. During this time, it in?icts 1 additional point of damage on a successful hit and affects targets that can only be affected by special transdimensional effects, such as those that are out of phase. Action to initiate.
[Tier5_moves]
Feint: (3 Speed points) | If you spend one action creating a misdirection or diversion, in the next round you can take advantage of your opponent’s lowered defenses. Make a melee attack roll against that opponent. The difficulty of the roll is decreased by one step. If your attack is successful, it in?icts 4 additional points of damage. Action. 
Snipe: (3 Speed points) | If you spend one action aiming, in the next round you can make a precise ranged attack. The difficulty of the attack roll is decreased by one step. If your attack is successful, it in?icts 4 additional points of damage. Action. 
Successive Attack: (2 Speed points) | If you take down a foe, you can immediately make another attack on that same turn against a new foe within your reach. The second attack is part of the same action. You can use this trick with melee attacks and ranged attacks. Enabler. 
Targeting Eye: You are trained in any physical ranged attack that is a trick of the trade or comes from a numenera device. For example, you are trained when using an Onslaught force blast because it's a physical attack, but not when using an Onslaught mindslice because it's a mental attack. You are trained when attacking with a death ray emitter because it comes from a numenera device, but not when using a crossbow because it's a mundane weapon. Enabler. 
Mastery with Defense: Choose one type of defense task in which you are trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You become specialized in defense tasks of that type. Unlike most tricks of the trade, you can select this trick up to three times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of defense task. Enabler.
[Tier6_moves]
Energy Protection: (4+ Intellect points) | Choose a discrete type of energy you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You gain +10 to Armor against damage from that type of energy for ten minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor against damage from that energy for 28 hours. You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can't protect against it. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can apply Effort to protect more targets, with each level of Effort affecting up to two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to protect them. Action to initiate.
Invisibility: (5 Intellect points) | You become invisible for ten minutes. While invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to initiate or reinitiate. 
Parry: (6 Speed points) | You can de?ect incoming attacks quickly. When you activate this trick, for the next 10 rounds you reduce the difficulty for all Speed defense rolls by one step. Enabler.
Spin Attack: (6 Speed points) | You stand still and make melee attacks against up to ?ve foes within reach, all as part of the same action in one round. Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modi?es your attack or damage applies to all of these attacks. Action. 
True Senses: You can see in complete darkness up to 50 feet (15 m) as if it were dim light. You recognize holograms, disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, and other such tricks (for all senses) for what they are. Enabler.
